    <h1>UIL NUMBER SENSE</h1>
    <hr>
    These tricks were thanks the the manual created by <a href="https://bryantheath.com/files/2018/04/Heath_NSTricks_revA.pdf" target=_blank title="This takes you to the manual">Bryant Heath</a>
      <p>I decided to make this webiste in order to visually explain the process of mental math. I could easily explain this through videos. However, wanted to create a site
      in which I can easily recieve problems at the click of a button. This saves me from having to write problems in the first place, and allows me to just focus on answering as quickly
      as possible. </p>
      <p>In the process of studying UIL Numbersense, I thought that I minus well practice coding at the same time. Before making this website, I've already had experience working on
      game development with C++. This project will prove challenging to me, since I have to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The latter I find to be the most easy, since it is 
      the most similar to C++ when it comes to syntax and logic.
